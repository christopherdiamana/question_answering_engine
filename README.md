# question_answering_engine
For this project, we will code a question-answering engine.

The engine is composed of the following parts :

  1) A search engine based on semantic similarity embedding
  2) A nearest neighbour approximation index
  3) An extractive QA model
  4) 
The idea is to build each of this part separately before putting them together.
